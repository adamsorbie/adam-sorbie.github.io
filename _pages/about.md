I am currently working in the [Benakis lab](https://www.isd-research.de/our-labs/benakis-lab/0b29bdd23b1f63b4) at the Institute for Stroke and Dementia research, LMU Klinikum Munich. We study the gut-brain axis and in particular, the involvement of the gut microbiota in stroke and stroke outcome. Previously, I worked on my PhD in the Haller lab at TU Munich, where my research focused mainly on identifying microbial factors driving colorectal cancer.  

During my PhD, I developed a keen interest in Bioinformatics and the analysis of large and complex datasets. Combining this passion for compuational biology with my background in the wet lab I am currently utilising a combination of next-generation sequencing, metabolomics, as well as more basic microbiological methods, to identify functional mechanisms modulating stroke outcome. 

In addition to my research, I am also enthusiastic about promoting open and reproducible science. We recently published a set of [guidelines](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2589-0042%2822%2900268-1) to conduct stroke microbiota studies in a robust and reproducible manner, providing an easy-to-use, freely-available [analysis pipeline](https://github.com/adamsorbie/Stroke_Microbiota_reproducibility) to allow researchers who are inexperienced in microbiota analysis to analyse their own data.  

Outside of the lab I enjoy exploring my adopted home, trying and learning new things and playing guitar.
